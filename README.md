## Setting up

### Set author name 
(to be show on version history)

```console
git config --global user.name "<firstname lastname>"
```
e.g.:
```console
git config --global user.name "Andr√©ia Bohner"
```

### Set email address

```console
git config --global user.email "<email>"
```

### Set automatic CLI coloring for Git

```console
git config --global color.ui auto
```

### Configure line-ending (CRLF)

```console
git config core.autocrlf
```
show current CRLF config

```console
git config --global core.autocrlf <input|true|false>
```
set line-ending style

- ```input```: convert crlf to lf on commit but not the other way around
- ```false```: turn off crlf
- ```true```: converts lf endings into crlf

e.g.: 
```console
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

### List all Git config settings

```console
git config --list
```

## Workflow

### Create a new repository from current local directory (local files)

```console
git init <repository_name>
```

### Create a new repository locally from a remote repository

```console
git clone <repository_url>
```
e.g:
```console
git clone https://github.com/path/repository.git
```

### Create a new branch

```console
git checkout -b <branch_name> [base_banch]
```

create a new branch based on `[base_branch]` or on current branch if `[base_banch]` isn't informed

or:

```console
git branch <branch_name>
```

create a new branch based on current branch

### List all local branches

```console
git branch
```

### List all local & remote branches

```console
git branch -a
```

### Get new changes, branches, and tags from remote repository

(just get the changes, it doesn't merge them - doesn't update tracking branches)

```console
git fetch <remote_name>
```

it's usually:

```console
git fetch origin
```

### Check changes on current branch

```console
git status
```

Show the status of your working directory: 
- new, staged, and modified files.
- current branch name
- current commit identifier
- changes pending to commit

### Add a local changed file to stage area

```console
git add <path/to/file.txt>
```

### Add all local changes to stage area

```console
git add .
```

### Commit staged local changes on current local branch

```console
git commit -m "commit message"
```

### Add all local files to stage area and commit, with one line:

```console
git commit -am "Commit message"
```

Equivalent to:

```console
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

### Change to another local branch

```console
git checkout <branch_name>
```

### Get a remote branch locally

```console
git fetch origin
git checkout <remote_branch_name>
```
or:
```console
git checkout -t origin/<remote_branch_name>
```

### Merge another local branch on current local branch

```console
git merge <branch_name_to_merge_on_current_branch>
```

### Merge changes from a remote branch on current local branch

(fetch from remote and merge into local)

```console
git pull origin <remote_branch_name>
```

### Conflicts

#### Resolve merge conflicts in favor of pulled changes during a pull

```console
git checkout --theirs <path/to/file.txt>
```

#### Resolve merge conflicts in favor of my local changes during a pull

```console
git checkout --ours <path/to/file.txt>
```

E.g.:

```console
git checkout --ours package-lock.json
```


### Push local changes to a remote branch

```console
git push origin <remote_branch_name>
```

- `-u`: add upstream (tracking) reference
```console
git push -u origin <remote_branch_name>
```

- `--tags`: push also the tags
```console
git push --tags origin <remote_branch_name>
```

- `--force`: if there are changes on remote branch that aren't in local branch (command refuses to update the remote), and you want to overwrite them:
```console
git push --force origin <remote_branch_name>
```

Note: You can use `HEAD` instead of `<remote_branch_name>`:
```console
git push origin HEAD
```

HEAD is the current branch on your local repository:

```console
cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/<name_of_the_branch>
```

### List all operations made on local repository

e.g.: commits, checkouts, pull, ... (also list removed commits with `git reset`, `git rebase`, ...) 

```console
git reflog
```

### Have to work on another branch. What to do with the changes on current branch?

Move them to stash: a place to temporarily store the modified and staged files in order to change branches

#### Put the current working directory changes into stash, for later use
```console
git stash
```

#### List stack-order of stashed file changes

```console
git stash list
```

#### Get the stored stash content into working directory, and drop it from stash.

```console
git stash pop
```

#### Pick a commit from a branch and apply it to another

```console
git cherry-pick <commit_hash>
```

#### Back to previous checkout branch

```console
git checkout -
```

## Checking changes

### Changes not staged

```console
git diff
```

### Changes staged but not commited

```console
git diff --staged
```

### Show all commits (Git history)

```console
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

## Rename Things

### Rename a local branch

```console
git branch -m <old_name> <new_name>
```

### Rename an existing remote name

List your existing remotes to get the name of the remote you want to change:

```console
git remote -v

> origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)
```

Rename the remote from `old_name` to `new_name`:

```console
git remote rename <old_name> <new_name>
```

E.g.:

```console
git remote rename origin production
```

Check that the remote URL has changed:

```console
git remote -v

> production  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> production  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)
```

### Rename the remote url of an existing local repository to match the renamed remote repository

To rename the existing local repository accordingly to the remote you can first
rename the repository directory (optional) and then, to rename the remote URL
to the new name:

List your existing remotes:

```console
git remote -v

> origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)
```

Rename the remote URL to `new_url`:

```console
git remote set-url <remote_name> <new_url>
```

- `<remote_name>` could be `origin` or `upstream` for example
- `<new_url>` could be the HTTPS or SSH URL

Change the `origin` remote's HTTPS URL e.g.:

```console
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/NEW-REPOSITORY.git
```

Change the `origin` remote's SSH URL e.g.:

```console
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/NEW-REPOSITORY.git
```

Check that the remote URL has changed:

```console
git remote -v

> origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/NEW-REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/NEW-REPOSITORY.git (push)
```

## Undo Things

### Unstage a file
(retain the changes in working directory)

```console
git reset HEAD <path/to/file.txt>
```

### Unstage all files
(retain the changes in working directory)

```console
git reset HEAD -- .
```

### Discard changes on unstaged file in working directory
(changes to the modified file are discarded)

```console
git checkout -- <path/to/file.txt>
```

### Discard changes on all unstaged files in working directory
(changes to the modified files are discarded)

```console
git checkout .
```

### Undo local commit

```console
git reset --soft HEAD^
```

```console
git reset HEAD <path/to/file.txt>
```

### Reverting changes

```console
git reset [--hard] <target_reference>
```

Switches the current branch to the target reference, leaving
a difference as an uncommitted change.

- `--hard`: discard all changes

```console
git revert <commit_sha>
```

Create a new commit, reverting changes from the specified commit.
It generates an inversion of changes.

### Reverting local changes to a relative time

```console
git reset --hard HEAD@{3.minutes.ago}
```

### Change the last (unpushed) commit message

```console
git commit --amend -m "New message here"
```

## Removing

### Remove local branch

```console
git branch -d <branch_name>
```
- `-D` instead of `-d` forces deletion

### Remove remote branch

```console
git push --delete <remote_name> <branch_name>
```
e.g.:
```console
git push --delete origin my_remote_branch
```

### Remove a tag from local repository

```console
git tag -d <name>
```

### Remove a tag from remote repository

```console
git push --delete origin <tag_name>
```
or:
```console
git push origin :refs/tags/tag_name
```

### Remove changes from stash

Remove the `[stash_name]` informed or the last one if none is provided.
```console
git stash drop [stash_name]
```
e.g.:
```console
git stash drop stash@{0}
```

### Remove untracked files
(Remove untracked files. Modified files are unchanged)

```console
git clean -f
```

### Remove untracked files and directories
(Remove untracked files and directories. Modified files are unchanged)

```console
git clean -f -d
```

## Tagging

Types of tags:
- `lightweight`: just the commit checksum stored in a file, i.e., a pointer to a specific commit
- `annotated`: stored as full objects in Git (checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard - GPG).

### List all tags

```console
git tag
```

### Show the current tag you are

```console
git describe --tags
```

### Create a lightweight tag for current commit or for [commit sha], if informed.

```console
git tag <tag_name> [commit_sha]
```

### Create an annoted tag for current commit if [commit sha] it's not informed 

```console
git tag -a <tag_name> [commit_sha] [-m "tagging_message"]
```
e.g.: 
```console
git tag -a v2.1 -m "version 2.1"
```

### Show tag data with the commit that was tagged

```console
git show <tag_name>
```
e.g.:
```console
git show v2.1
```

## Updating Remote

Change the remote's URL from SSH to HTTPS:

```console
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
```

Change the remote's URL from HTTPS to SSH:

```console
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
```
